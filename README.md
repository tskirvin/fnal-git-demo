Hi there, Fermi folks!  

This is the git repository I used when writing up my slides for the git
demo from 2014-10-01 at Fermi Lab.  It may come in handy when you're
looking at the slides.

If you're looking to explore, run this on your local host:

    git clone https://github.com/tskirvin/fnal-git-demo

Marc's talk is here: http://www-oss.fnal.gov/~mengel/Talks/git_fermi/slides.html

Amit will give me some materials to put up soon.

And I still recommend the 'Git for Ages 4 and Up' talk: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ffBJ4sVUb4
