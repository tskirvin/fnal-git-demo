Hi there, Fermi folks!  

This is the git repository I used when writing up my slides for the git
demo from 2014-10-01 at Fermi Lab.  It may come in handy when you're
looking at the slides.

If you're looking to explore, run this on your local host:

    git clone https://github.com/tskirvin/fnal-git-demo
